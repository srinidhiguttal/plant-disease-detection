# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection Using CNN

A deep learning-based web application that detects plant leaf diseases and recommends pesticide action based on infection severity.

---

## 👥 Team Project
This project was collaboratively developed by:
- **Srinidhi Guttal**  
- **Siri Chandana P Katti**

### 🧩 Implementation
- Designed and implemented the **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for leaf disease detection.  
- Developed the **infection severity classification module** to categorize infection levels as *Low, Medium,* or *High.*  
- Integrated a **pesticide recommendation system** to guide farmers on whether spraying is required.  
- Assisted in testing and deployment of the system interface.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects plant leaf diseases from uploaded images using CNN.  
- Shows real-time infection severity (Low / Medium / High).  
- Provides actionable pesticide recommendations.  
- Simple, interactive, and easy-to-use interface.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset & Model
- Trained on publicly available plant disease image datasets.  
- CNN model trained with image augmentation and regularization to improve accuracy.  
- Performance metrics visualized using confusion matrix and accuracy plots.

---

## 📦 Future Scope
- Integration with IoT-based crop monitoring systems.  
- Addition of real-time detection via mobile camera input.  
- Deployment on cloud (Flask / Streamlit) for easy farmer access.
